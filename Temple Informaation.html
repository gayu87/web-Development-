    		<h4><p><dd>The temple, classified within traditional Hindu architecture as a ‘Shikharbadha mandir,’
			has been built according to principles laid out in the Shilpa Shastras. 
			The Shilpa Shastras are Hindu texts prescribing standards of sacred architecture.
		    Within the mandir are different shrines, in which murtis (sacred images of Hindu deities)
			have been installed.shrines hold the murtis of Ghanshyam Maharaj, Harikrishna Maharaj, Shri Radha Krishna, Shri Shiva Parvati,
			The murtis become worthy of worship after being imbued with the living presence of the deities.
			Accordingly,sadhus (Hindu monks) offer devotional worship to the deities throughout the day.
			The sadhus awaken the deities before dawn by singing morning hymns, called prabhatiya. 
			Managala aarti, which is the first of five aartis, is also performed at this time. 
			Aarti is a ritual where devotees sing the glory of God while a lighted wick is circulated before the murtis.
			After managala aarti, the deities are bathed and offered food and garments that vary with the season.
			After the murtis have been adorned with garments, shangaar aarti is performed.
			At midday, rajabhoga aarti is performed and food is offered to the murtis.
			Food that has been offered to the deities is considered sanctified, and is distributed to devotees as holy prasadam.
			In the evening, sandhya aarti is performed before offering food to the murtis.</dd></p></h4>
