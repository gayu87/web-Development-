           <h2> Festival</h2>
		   <h3>Uttarayan</h3>
	<img id="wrapper" src="u.jpg" alt= "'Uttarayan'" height="200" weight="200">
    		 <p>On January 14 the sun enters 
                      the rashi Capricorn. This is known as 'Uttarayan' or Makar 
                      Sankranti. Sankranti means the entry of the sun from one 
                      zodiac to another.</p>
                    <p>From the south the sun shifts 
                      northwards. Daylight hours increase from this day. The actual 
                      sankranti occurs in an extremely short period.</p>
                    <p>The sun's sankranti also 
                      occurs in other rashis, as do other planets. However only 
                      the sun's sankranti into Makar is considered auspicious 
                      and meritorious. According to Jaimini rishi, 12 hours and 
                      46 minutes pre-and-post sankranti are considered sacred. 
                      During this time-span, the cow, edible food, money, vehicles, 
                      clothes, flowers or grass are donated to Brahmins, the poor 
                      and ascetics; resulting in infinite punya(merits). Haribhaktos 
                      donate grains or money in the mandir.</p>

<h3>Diwali</h3>
	<img id="wrapper" src="d.jpg" alt= "'Uttarayan'" height="200" weight="200">

	the ancient Indian civilization and its history is magnificently intertwined with origins and evolution of Hindu religion. 
	Today, this festival has become epitome of enjoyment and is celebrated with great exuberance across the country. 
	The mere mention of Diwali conjures up images of diyas, firecrackers and gifts; however,
	Diwali is not just about these things, there is a much deeper significance to it. Tracing the roots 
	of this festival and understanding its history may help one actually fathom the real meaning of Diwali.
	This article is an endeavor to shed light on the history behind the origins and grand celebrations of this vivacious festival.</p>

    	<h3>Navratri</h3>
		<img id="wrapper" src="na.jpg" alt= "'Uttarayan'" height="200" weight="200">
       <p>Hindu festival of nine nights dedicated to the glorification of Shakti,
      the feminine form of the Divine. During these nine nights, the mother goddess is worshipped in
 nine different forms. Navratri culminates on the 10th day with the festivities of Vijayadasham, 
 also known as Dussehra, which celebrates the triumph of good over evil. A common greeting during this festival is 
 <em>Shubh Navratri</em> (Happy Navratri).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Navratri is celebrated all over India
 and among the Hindu diaspora with great fanfare. 
 Prior to the festival, skilled artisans prepare clay models of the goddess in her various manifestations.
 Many Hindus take part in special ceremonies, rituals, fasts and festivities. People buy new clothes,
 prepare delicious sweets and buy gifts for family and friends.</p>
